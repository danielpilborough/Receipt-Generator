# Receipt Generator

📄Fake Receipt Generator created using 🐍Python.🐍

Simply enter the amount of items you would like to see on the receipt and it will do the rest.

You will then see a receipt with randomly generated: shop name, item list, transaction ID, card number etc. (apart from datetime...need to update this)

## Roadmap

- Random datetime or allow user to enter date and time.

- Allow user to enter amount they need the receipt to add up to.

- Allow user to choose type of items, such as groceries, office supplies etc.

- Allow user to enter custom items.

- Export to PDF (the library for this is in the initial commit but I need to learn how to use reportlab without ChatGPT...)

- Various other improvements.


## Lessons Learned

I've decided for better or worse that Python is the language im going to stick with to learn the basic fundamentals of programming. For the most part I have been creating webapps (with Flask) as thats what I enjoy, however I really want to learn and not rely on AI to simply vibe code my way through. I've started doing random little projects such as this one to practice. This one really helped me understand storing data in lists and looping through them to get, store and compare data; it has been really valuable. There's definitely some areas of improvement and no doubt excessive and inefficient code however it works and for now that is what im focused on.
